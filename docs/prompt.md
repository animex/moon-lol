@dash.rs Remove the damage logic from dash, keep only the displacement logic. I will change it to spawn a missile during dash, making it a child of the caster, so the missile will follow the caster. This missile will do collision detection every n frames, dealing damage to enemies within range. The missile deals maximum n instances of damage to each enemy unit. For other damage range, filtering and specific structures, refer to @damage.rs. Then we can remove ActionDamage and fully use this missile for ability damage, because ActionDamage can be viewed as a damage missile that exists for only 1 frame with 0 velocity.
